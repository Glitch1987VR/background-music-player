# background-music-player

This is one of my first Python projects.
Use it as you want!

It checks for audio playing in the background, and starts playing audios from a directory when it's silent.
The most up-to-date version is the one in the root folder, older versions are in old_files
Currently wait-times and directory locations can only be edited via the script (use VS Code or any other editing software),
more "instructions" in the script.

You'll need to install pip and then run:
``pip install -r "path\to\\.requirements.txt"``
