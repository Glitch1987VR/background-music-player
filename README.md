# background-music-player

This is one of my first Python projects.
Use it as you want!

It checks for audio playing in the background, and starts playing audios from a directory when it's silent.
The most up-to-date version is the one in the root folder, older versions are in old_files
Currently wait-times and directory locations can only be edited via the script (use VS Code or any other editing software),
more "instructions" in the script.
