# background-music-player

This is one of my first Python projects.
Use it as you want!

It checks for audio playing in the background, and starts playing audios from a directory when it's silent.
The most up-to-date version is the one in the root folder, older versions are in old_files
Currently wait-times can only be edited via the script (use VS Code or any other editing software),
more "instructions" in the script (I think).

# requirements
You'll need to install pip and then run:
``pip install -r "path\to\.requirements.txt"``

The script should create a config in the folder it's contained in, so put it in a seperate folder
